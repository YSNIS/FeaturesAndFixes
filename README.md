Features and Fixes is a webapp that allows video game players to add features and fixes to games they'd like to see implemented.

Users can add a game to the database, add an issue as either a features or a fix, upvote those issues, add comments to issues, and upvote comments.

I am creating this webapp in order to learn the MEAN stack (mongodb, express.js, angular.js, node.js) as well as how to do proper unit testing.
